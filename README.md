# From the leaf to the gut and back again: the fate and influence of phyllosphere bacteria in a gnotobiotic *Arabidopsis* – *Pieris brassicae* system

Analysis code and documentation for the manuscript on leaf-associated synthetic microbial communities shaping *Pieris brassicae* herbivory outcomes.

## Overview

This repository includes all the R scripts to reproduce the analysis of the manuscript XX published in. The scripts include:

- Effect of SynCom richness on larval performance
- Phytohormone analysis
- Bacterial community analysis

All datasets to reproduce the findings of our publication are stored in the associated Zenodo repository. Raw 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data are available in the EMBL-ENI ENA BioProject accession XXX.
